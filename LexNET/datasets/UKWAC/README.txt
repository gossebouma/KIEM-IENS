Data used for cross-domain validation

Run the make command to link train.tsv and val.tsv and relations.txt from the DBpedia directory

test.tsv is a subset of pairs extracted from the UKWAC corpus. 
Every pair in test has been assigned the (bogus) relation label country.

Output of testing needs to be verified manually as we have no gold standard.
