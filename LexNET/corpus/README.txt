parse_wikipedia_gb.py is a slightly modified version of the original parse_wikipedia.py which has better support for recognizing multiword named entities and a few other bug fixes (see GB in the comments).
parse_wikipedia_open_vocab.py is a modified version of the same that does not require a vocabulary

create_corpus_from_wikipedia.py is a slightly more robust version of the original. 
I did not need the efficiency improvements suggested in LexNET-2, so this is just the old version of the script.
